# CCXT

The CCXT integration is in alpha and is not yet published to npm. Install directly from the branch (see below).

[CCXT](https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt) is an open-source library that provides a unified trading API across 100+ cryptocurrency exchanges. The dreamDEX integration lets you use the same familiar CCXT interface to interact with the DEX.

The source lives on the [add-dreamdex-exchange](https://github.com/somnia-chain/ccxt/tree/add-dreamdex-exchange) branch of Somnia's CCXT fork. TypeScript source and built JavaScript are available; other CCXT-supported languages (Python, PHP, C#, Go) have not yet been generated.

## Installation

Install directly from the branch:

```text
npm install github:somnia-chain/ccxt#add-dreamdex-exchange
```

## REST API

```text
import ccxt from 'ccxt';

const exchange = new ccxt.dreamdex({
    walletAddress: '0xYourAddress',
    privateKey: '0xYourPrivateKey',
});

// Public – no authentication required
const markets = await exchange.fetchMarkets();
const ticker = await exchange.fetchTicker('SOMI/USDC');
const orderBook = await exchange.fetchOrderBook('SOMI/USDC');
const trades = await exchange.fetchTrades('SOMI/USDC');
const candles = await exchange.fetchOHLCV('SOMI/USDC', '1h');

// Authenticated
const order = await exchange.createOrder('SOMI/USDC', 'limit', 'buy', 100, 1.5);
// → returns an unsigned EVM transaction to sign and broadcast
```

`createOrder` returns an unsigned EVM transaction (`{ chainId, data, to, value }`), not a confirmed order. You must sign and broadcast it to the Somnia network yourself — see the [Quick Start](https://docs.dreamdex.io/ld25g222WKDrLlJMcR41/welcome/quick-start) guide for the full flow.

## WebSocket (Pro)

```text
import ccxt from 'ccxt';

const exchange = new ccxt.pro.dreamdex({
    walletAddress: '0xYourAddress',
    privateKey: '0xYourPrivateKey',
});

// Real-time order book
while (true) {
    const orderBook = await exchange.watchOrderBook('SOMI/USDC');
    console.log(orderBook.bids[0], orderBook.asks[0]);
}
```

Supported WebSocket methods: `watchOrderBook`, `watchTrades`, `watchOHLCV`.

## Vault Operations

The integration exposes dreamDEX [vault](https://docs.dreamdex.io/ld25g222WKDrLlJMcR41/developers/http-api/vault) operations as additional methods. Each returns an unsigned transaction.

```text
await exchange.vaultApprove('SOMI/USDC', 'SOMI', 100);
await exchange.vaultDeposit('SOMI/USDC', 'SOMI', 100);
await exchange.vaultWithdraw('SOMI/USDC', 'SOMI', 50);
const balance = await exchange.fetchBalance({ symbol: 'SOMI/USDC' });
```
