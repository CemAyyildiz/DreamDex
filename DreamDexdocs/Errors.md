# Errors

This page documents all error conditions for the WebSocket API, including close codes, connection failures, and application-level error messages.

## WebSocket Close Codes

The server uses standard and application-specific WebSocket close codes:

| Code | Name | Trigger | Client Action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1000 | Normal Closure | Connection closed gracefully by server | No action needed |
| 1001 | Going Away | Server is shutting down (graceful shutdown) | Reconnect after a delay with backoff |
| 4001 | Slow Consumer | Client's send buffer is full (can't keep up with message rate) | Reconnect and resubscribe for a fresh snapshot |

## Connection-Level Failures

These failures result in a silent close with no WebSocket close frame sent:

| Failure | Trigger | Timeout | Client Observation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Read Timeout | No message received within 60s | 60s | Connection drops; send pings every <30s to prevent |
| Read Error | Underlying TCP/TLS error during read | -- | Connection drops unexpectedly |
| Write Error | TCP/TLS write failure in write loop | -- | Connection drops unexpectedly |
| Upgrade Rejected | Server shutting down during HTTP upgrade | -- | HTTP 503 Service Unavailable |

To avoid read timeouts, send a `{"operation": "ping"}` heartbeat at least every 30 seconds.

## Protocol Errors

Errors returned by [REST-over-WebSocket operations](https://docs.dreamdex.io/ld25g222WKDrLlJMcR41/developers/websocket-api/operations) as JSON messages with `type` set to `"error"`:

```text
{"type": "error", "errorName": "...", "message": "...", "id": 1}
```

The `id` field echoes the request ID when available, allowing clients to correlate errors with specific requests.

| errorName | Trigger | Example Message |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `invalid_request` | Unparseable JSON or missing `operation` field | `"invalid JSON request"`, `"missing operation field"` |
| `unknown_operation` | `operation` doesn't match any OpenAPI operationId | `"unknown operation: invalidOp"` |
| `invalid_parameters` | Missing/invalid path or query parameters | `"missing required path parameter: symbol"` |
| `too_many_requests` | Per-connection concurrent request limit exceeded (default 100) | `"too many concurrent requests, try again later"` |
| `internal_error` | Unhandled server-side error during dispatch | `"internal error"` |
